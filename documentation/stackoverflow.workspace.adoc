Every developer has a tab open https://stackoverflow.com/[Stack Overflow^], the massively popular question-and-answer site. 
This dataset explores users, questions, answers, comments, and tags related to the `neo4j`- and `cypher`- tagged questions on Stack Overflow.

This guide will show you how to:

* Create: load questions, answers, comments, tags, and users into the graph
* Find: Find unanswered questions
* Query: discover the most engaged users and most popular questions

Throughout the guide you'll find Cypher statements that you can execute by clicking on the play button.

If you want to modify a statement, click the arrow instead to copy the statement to the Cypher editor, where you can modify before executing.

== The Model

image::{img}/model.svg[width=100%]

=== Nodes

We model the `Users`, `Questions`, `Answers`, `Comments`, and `Tags` as nodes. 

=== Relationships

Users ask questions, comment, and provide answers.

`(:User)-[:ASKED]->(:Question)`
`(:User)-[:COMMENTED]->(:Comment)`
`(:User)-[:PROVIDED]->(:Answer)`

Answers attempt to answer questions, comments are made on questions, and questions are associated with tags.  

`(:Answer)-[:ANSWERED]->(:Question)`
`(:Comment)-[:COMMENTED_ON]->(:Question)`
`(:Question)-[:TAGGED]->(:Tag)`

If you want to see it yourself, run:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.visualization();
----

== Load JSON Import

There is already data preloaded in this graph, if you want to extend (more pages or other tags) or update it with the most recent questions, please modify and run the statement below.

Update this dataset using `apoc.load.json`.
 Run the query as-is to update or add a tag to the `tags` array to extend. 

[source,cypher]
----
// look for several pages of questions
WITH ["neo4j","cypher"] as tags 
UNWIND tags as tagName
UNWIND range(1,2) as page

WITH "https://api.stackexchange.com/2.3/questions?page="+page+"&pagesize=25&order=desc&sort=creation&tagged="+tagName+"&site=stackoverflow&filter=!5-i6Zw8Y)4W7vpy91PMYsKM-k9yzEsSC1_Uxlf" as url

CALL apoc.load.json(url) YIELD value
CALL apoc.util.sleep(250)  // careful with throttling

UNWIND value.items AS q

// create the questions
MERGE (question:Question {uuid:q.question_id})
  ON CREATE SET question.title = q.title, 
  	question.link = q.share_link, 
  	question.creation_date = q.creation_date, 
  	question.accepted_answer_id=q.accepted_answer_id, 
  	question.view_count=q.view_count,
   	question.answer_count=q.answer_count,

MERGE (owner)-[:ASKED]->(question)

// what tags do the questions have
FOREACH (tagName IN q.tags | 
  MERGE (tag:Tag {name:tagName}) 
    ON CREATE SET tag.link = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/" + tag.name
  MERGE (question)-[:TAGGED]->(tag))

// who answered the questions?

  MERGE (comment)<-[:COMMENTED]-(commenter)

== Basic Queries

Labels in the graph and counts for each:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n)
RETURN labels(n) as label, count(*) as freq
ORDER BY freq DESC;
----

Relationship-types in the graph and counts for eachabel:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH ()-[r]->()
RETURN type(r) as type, count(*) as freq
ORDER BY freq DESC;
----

== Top Tags

Which are the most popular tags?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (q:Question)-[:TAGGED]->(t:Tag)
RETURN t.name,  count(q) AS questions
ORDER BY questions DESC
LIMIT 5;
----

== Exploring Users

Who are the top users asking questions?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[:ASKED]->(q:Question)
RETURN u.display_name, count(*) AS questions
ORDER by questions DESC 
LIMIT 10;
----

Who's answering? 

Ordered by number of answers 

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[:PROVIDED]->(a:Answer)-[:ANSWERED]->(q:Question)
RETURN u.display_name as user,COUNT(a) AS answers, avg(a.score) as avg_score
ORDER BY answers DESC LIMIT 10;
----

Ordered by max score, filtered for a particular tag

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[:PROVIDED]->(a:Answer)-[:ANSWERED]->
      (q:Question)-[:TAGGED]->(:Tag {name:"cypher"})
RETURN u.display_name as user,COUNT(a) AS answers, max(a.score) as max_score
ORDER BY max_score DESC LIMIT 10;
----

What's the shortest path between users?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = allShortestPaths(
  (u1:User {display_name:"alexanoid"})-[*]-(u2:User {display_name:"InverseFalcon"})
)
RETURN path LIMIT 1;
----

== User Engagement

User engagement over time:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[:PROVIDED]->()-[:ANSWERED]->
      (q:Question)-[:TAGGED]->(t:Tag)
WHERE u.display_name = "InverseFalcon"
RETURN apoc.date.format(q.creation_date,'s','yyyy-MM') as month, 
       count(distinct q) as count, collect(distinct t.name) as tags
ORDER BY month asc
----

== Unanswered Questions

What are the tags for unanswered questions?

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (q:Question)-[:TAGGED]->(t:Tag)
WHERE NOT t.name IN ['neo4j','cypher'] 
  AND NOT (q)<-[:ANSWERED]-()
RETURN t.name as tag, count(q) AS questions
ORDER BY questions DESC LIMIT 10;
----

== How are tags related to other tags?

Tag correlations:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t1:Tag)<-[:TAGGED]-()-[:TAGGED]->(t2:Tag)
WHERE id(t1) < id(t2) and t1.name <> 'neo4j' and t2.name <> 'neo4j'
RETURN t1.name, t2.name,count(*) as freq
ORDER BY freq desc LIMIT 10;
----

== Virtual Graphs: Tags

Project tags via co-occurrence with virtual relationships.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t1:Tag)<-[:TAGGED]-()-[:TAGGED]->(t2:Tag)
WHERE id(t1) < id(t2) and t1.name <> 'neo4j' and t2.name <> 'neo4j'
WITH t1, t2,count(*) as freq  where freq > 3
RETURN t1,t2, apoc.create.vRelationship(t1,'OCCURRED',{freq:freq},t2) as rel
----

If you want to, you can also materialize those relationships in the graph and then explore the data in the _Explore_ tab.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t1:Tag)<-[:TAGGED]-()-[:TAGGED]->(t2:Tag)
WHERE id(t1) < id(t2) and t1.name <> 'neo4j' and t2.name <> 'neo4j'
WITH t1, t2,count(*) as freq  where freq > 3
MERGE (t1)-[r:OCCURRED]-(t2) SET r.freq=freq
RETURN count(*)
----

== Virtual Graphs: Social Network

We can do something similar for commenters - what users keep on running into each other in the comments? 

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH p1=(u1:User)-[:COMMENTED]->(c1:Comment)-[:COMMENTED_ON]-(q:Question)
MATCH p2=(u2:User)-[:COMMENTED]->(c2:Comment)-[:COMMENTED_ON]-(q)
WHERE id(u1) < id(u2)
WITH u1, u2, count(distinct q) as freq
WHERE freq > 2
RETURN u1, u2, apoc.create.vRelationship(u1,'OCCURRED',{freq:freq},u2) as rel
